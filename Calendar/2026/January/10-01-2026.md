- **Focus**: CI/CD infrastructure and build system improvements

**Work Details:**
- **6:30-7:00: Early Morning Infrastructure**

- **8:30-11:30: Core Execution & Quality**
    - **Simulation & Build**: Fixed simulator destination issues in the CI workflow by simplifying the build command to use SDK targets instead of specific devices.
    - **Code Quality**: Addressed multiple SwiftLint violations, refined the linting configuration, and moved linting tasks out of the main build phase to speed up CI.
    - **Bug Fixes**: Resolved duplicate definitions in `ConsultationFeature` and fixed various compilation errors to stabilize the main branch.

    - **UI/UX**: Refined the 2026 calendar view to only show links for existing monthly directories, improving the vault's navigability.
