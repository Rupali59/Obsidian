Split time between documenting new calendar narratives inside the Obsidian vault and keeping the WorkTracker Quartz deployment healthy (dependencies, redirects, sync automation) so the public site stays perfectly aligned with the vault.

### Development Summary

**🔧 Projects Worked On:**

#### **1. Obsidian Vault**
*Knowledge Management System*

- **Commits**: 1
- **Focus**: Calendar Publishing & Narrative Quality

**Work Details:**
- Added technical writeups for November 13–14 entries so exported notes carry full context
- Synced analytics tables alongside the narratives to keep historical dashboards accurate
- Ensured downstream Quartz automations can mirror the refreshed markdown without manual edits

**📝 Commit:**
- `1b80a2a` – Published November 13–14 calendar entries with human-readable technical summaries and updated analytics tables

#### **2. WorkTracker**
*Quartz Static Site backed by the vault*

- **Commits**: 9
- **Pull Requests**: 1
- **Issues**: 1
- **Focus**: Dependency Health, Content Sync Automation, Quartz Upstream Merge

**Work Details:**
- **Dependency & Preview Reliability**: Refreshed production dependency set, added `index.md` homepage, and implemented redirect logic so local previews use the same `baseDir` as production
- **Calendar Synchronization**: Synced new Obsidian entries, removed deleted files, and switched to filesystem timestamps so Git only tracks meaningful changes
- **Quartz Upstream Alignment**: Temporarily replaced symlinks with real files to avoid merge conflicts, then pulled the latest Quartz changes while preserving custom cards and styling

**📝 Commits:**
- `588a1e1` – Updated production dependencies to eliminate security noise
- `77981d7` – Added `index.md` homepage for Quartz and improved default routing
- `def4296` – Added redirect from root path to `baseDir` to make local previews match prod
- `1ec335b` – Pulled new calendar content from Obsidian into the public site
- `6664ba9` – Merged upstream Quartz changes without losing custom components
- `8500515` – Replaced symlinked content with actual files to unblock the upstream merge

### Technical Insights

**🔍 Work Patterns:**
- ~90% of the effort targeted Quartz automation and infrastructure, with the rest invested in vault documentation
- Automation changes ensure WorkTracker mirrors Obsidian within the same day

**🛠️ Highlights:**
- Dependency refresh + redirect fixes keep local previews identical to production
- Filesystem-first timestamping removes accidental Git diffs during automated syncs
- Quartz and Obsidian now share identical narrative + analytics data, eliminating drift
