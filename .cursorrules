# Cursor Rules for Obsidian Vault

## File Creation Rules

### README Files
- **NEVER** create, suggest, or automatically add README files (README.md, README.txt, etc.) without explicitly asking the user first
- If a README file is needed, always prompt the user with:
  - Why it's needed
  - What content should be included
  - Whether they want to proceed
- Only proceed with README creation after receiving explicit user approval

### General File Creation
- Always ask before creating new files or directories
- Explain the purpose and structure of any suggested file organization
- Respect the existing Obsidian vault structure and naming conventions

## Code Generation Rules

### Documentation
- When suggesting code documentation, prefer inline comments over separate documentation files
- If external documentation is needed, ask the user first

### Project Structure
- Maintain the existing Obsidian vault organization
- Follow the established pattern of Notes/, Calendar/, Scripts/ directories
- Preserve the markdown-based note-taking approach

## User Consultation Requirements

### Always Ask Before:
- Creating new top-level directories
- Adding configuration files
- Modifying existing file structures
- Introducing new file types or formats

### Explain Before Proceeding:
- The purpose of any suggested changes
- How changes will affect the existing workflow
- Alternative approaches if available

## Obsidian-Specific Rules

- Respect the `.obsidianignore` file
- Maintain the markdown format for notes
- Preserve the calendar structure and naming conventions
- Keep the existing note organization system intact
