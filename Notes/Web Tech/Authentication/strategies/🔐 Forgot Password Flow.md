## 📘 ELI15 Summary

When you click **"Remember Me"**, the system gives you a longer-lasting key so you don’t have to log in every time. It’s like getting a valet card — show it and skip the queue.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User logs in → Checks "Remember Me"
    
2. Server sends back two tokens:
    
    - **Session token** (short-lived)
        
    - **Refresh/remember-me token** (long-lived)
        
3. When the session token expires:
    
    - If remember-me token is present and valid → issue new session token

## 🔐 Token Options

- **JWT Refresh Tokens**
    
- **Opaque tokens** stored server-side (with DB lookup)
    
- **Secure cookies** with long expiry + fingerprinting
    

---

## ✅ Pros

- Improves user experience
    
- Low friction login
    

## ❌ Cons

- Long-lived tokens are a security risk if stolen
    
- Token rotation and revocation required
    

---

## ⚠️ Common Threats

- **Token theft** from localStorage or cookies
    
- **Replay attacks** if token reused
    
- **Fingerprint mismatch bypass**
    

---

## 🛡️ Best Practices

- Store token in **httpOnly secure cookies**
    
- Tie tokens to **device/browser fingerprint**
    
- Rotate token on every use
    
- Invalidate token on logout or password change
    
- Allow users to revoke remembered devices

## 🧪 Flow Sample

```text
1. Login with "Remember Me" checked
2. Save refresh token in httpOnly cookie
3. On session expiry → check refresh token
4. If valid → issue new session token
```
