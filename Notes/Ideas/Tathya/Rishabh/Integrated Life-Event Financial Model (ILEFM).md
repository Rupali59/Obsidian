**Project Title:** Integrated Life-Event Financial Model (ILEFM)

**Objective:** To create a unified financial intelligence system that manages high-variance outflows (Medical & Marriage) against fixed income/savings while on the bench.

### 1. The Requirement: Data Collection & Mapping

He must identify and categorize every data source before any analysis begins.

- **Medical Stream:** Hospital bills, pharmacy receipts, diagnostic charges, and health insurance claim statuses.
    
- **Marriage Stream:** Venue deposits, vendor quotes, and estimated future liabilities.
    
- **Fixed Stream:** Bangalore PG rent, utility bills, and Bhopal-Bangalore travel logistics.
    
- **Inflow Stream:** Salary (if any), interest income, and existing corpus.
    

### 2. The AI-Task: "The Intelligent Audit"

Ask him to perform the following using AI tools:

1. **Automated Categorization:** Use **ChatGPT (Advanced Data Analysis)** or **Claude** to ingest his bank CSVs and auto-tag transactions based on a custom taxonomy (e.g., "Health," "Wedding-Capital," "Living-Essentials").
    
2. **Predictive Scenario Modeling:** Use AI to answer: _"If Medical Expenses exceed the estimate by 15%, what is the impact on the Marriage budget for Q4 2026?"_

## Phase 1 Task for the Analyst: "The Discovery Memo"

**Goal:** He needs to define the _problem_ before he looks for the _solution_.

**Instructions for him:** "I want you to act as a Consultant. Before you touch a spreadsheet, provide a **Discovery Memo** that includes:"

1. **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):** A simple map showing how his bank accounts, UPI apps, and cash interact with his major expense 'buckets' (Medical, Marriage, PG).
    
2. **Gap Analysis:** What data is currently missing? (e.g., _'I don't have the final quote for the wedding caterer yet'_).
    
3. **Tool Stack Proposal:** A list of which AI tools he will use to ensure this is an automated system, not just a manual log.
