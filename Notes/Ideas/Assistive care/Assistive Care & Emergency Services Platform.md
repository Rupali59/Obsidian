## **1. Core Idea (In Simple Words)**

  

Create a **single system** that:

- Trains and certifies caretakers
    
- Helps families find reliable care quickly
    
- Manages medical and emergency needs end-to-end
    
- Works especially well during **crises** (elderly care, sudden illness, accidents)
    

  

Think of it as **“Urban Company + Practo + Emergency Helpline”** for assistive and medical care.

## **2. The Problem We Are Solving**

  

### **For Families**

- Hard to find **trusted caretakers**
    
- No standard way to judge caretaker quality
    
- Chaos during emergencies (ambulance, doctor, hospital coordination)
    
- No single point of accountability
    

  

### **For Caretakers**

- No structured training
    
- Low credibility, low pay
    
- No career progression or certification
    

  

### **For Hospitals / Doctors**

- Poor coordination with on-ground caregivers
    
- Incomplete patient context during emergencies
