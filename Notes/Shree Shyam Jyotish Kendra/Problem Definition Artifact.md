# üåü CRM System Planning: Problem Definition & Direction

This document outlines the **observed gaps**, **organizational inefficiencies**, and **emerging needs** for a comprehensive CRM tailored to the operations of an astrology-focused organization.

The intent is to define a **clear problem space**, not to design the system yet. Detailed technical specifications and module-level designs will follow in a separate phase.

---

## üß† 1. Problem Statement

The current system suffers from significant fragmentation. Operational data is scattered across:

- Excel sheets, paper notes, browser links, and bookmarks
- Google Contacts and Gmail
- WhatsApp (WATI, Business), Knowlarity
- Website form responses
- Social media platforms (Instagram, YouTube)
- Manual logs for gemstone orders and client appointments

This leads to:
- Duplication of efforts across staff
- Inefficiencies in responding to leads or managing orders
- Lack of a single source of truth for users or inventory
- Poor visibility into marketing, lead sources, or campaign success

We need a centralized, modular CRM system to **consolidate workflows**, enable visibility, and support business growth in a structured way.

## üåê 2. Organizational Context

- **Primary Stakeholder**: Pawan Kaushik (Astrologer and System Owner)
- **Team**: A small but growing team handling operations, consultations, marketing, and gemstone sales
- **Website**: [https://www.pawankaushik.com/](https://www.pawankaushik.com/)
- **Presence**: Active on Google, Instagram, YouTube, WhatsApp, Knowlarity
- **Offices**: Two locations managing gemstone inventory and consultations
- **Documentation Format**: Mostly paper or Excel-based at present

---

## üß© 3. Core Goals of the Future System

Without designing the system yet, we recognize the following **areas where structured capabilities are needed**:

- Unified **user and contact management**
- Streamlined **role-based access** and staff journeys (guest ‚Üí astrologer/staff)
- Better **data merging and profile integrity**
- Synchronized communication across Gmail, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc.
- Internal coordination through **task tracking** and lightweight office ops tools
- Structured tracking of **appointments**, **orders**, and **inventory**
- Consolidated **content creation and publishing workflow**
- Visibility into **lead sources**, **campaigns**, and **audience segments**
- Support for **basic IT tracking** (device registry, access logs)

## üîç 4. Observed Subsystem Gaps

### 4.1 User and Contact Management
- Contacts are duplicated across tools with no unified identity
- Inconsistent tagging, role assignment, or contact merging
- New leads often fall through due to unclear follow-up processes

### 4.2 Appointment & Consultation Tracking
- Appointments happen via WhatsApp or calls with no centralized schedule
- No historical visibility into who met when, and for what service
- Astrologers lack structured workflow for session documentation

### 4.3 Order & Inventory Management
- Gemstone tracking is manual
- No visibility into stock levels across offices
- Orders lack clear lifecycle records (quote ‚Üí confirm ‚Üí delivery)

### 4.4 Internal Task Management
- No structured way to assign or follow up on internal tasks
- Team accountability suffers due to lack of documented ownership

### 4.5 Device & Resource Tracking
- Basic recordkeeping is needed to track phones, laptops, etc.
- Ensures smoother support, onboarding, and compliance

### 4.6 Lead Funnel & Follow-Up
- No funnel to track lead stages (e.g., inquiry ‚Üí warm ‚Üí converted)
- Lead source attribution is unclear
- Missed follow-ups due to absence of reminders or pipeline views

### 4.7 Content & Publishing Workflow
- Content (blogs, quotes, videos, social posts) created manually without centralized workflow
- No content calendar, approval workflow, or multi-platform status tracking
- Asset reuse (e.g., reposting a quote or video) is inconsistent

### 4.8 Marketing Analytics & Campaign Visibility
- Ad spend and organic content performance is not tracked centrally
- Unclear which channel brings in which type of lead or sale
- No reporting layer to assess ROI or trends

### 4.9 Workflow Automation (Currently Missing)
- Tasks like follow-up reminders, tagging new leads, or auto-routing inquiries are manual
- No automation layer exists for recurring, low-effort workflows

### 4.10 Document & Knowledge Sharing
- No central system for SOPs, FAQs, onboarding guides, or service handbooks
- Internal training and client communication depend on ad hoc conversations

## üîß 5. System Requirements (Framed as Needs, Not Features)

At a high level, we are looking for a CRM that can eventually address the following needs:

- Consolidate contact and user information from multiple sources
- Enable smooth onboarding and transitions between user roles
- Provide a unified communication trail across Gmail, WhatsApp, etc.
- Give astrologers and staff a structured appointment/consultation tool
- Handle inventory, orders, and gemstone product tracking
- Streamline internal team coordination with task and approval flows
- Enable content planning, publishing, and performance analysis from a single point
- Track and attribute leads from all major channels
- Offer insights into team performance, marketing ROI, and client behavior
- Keep basic documentation of internal SOPs and device usage
