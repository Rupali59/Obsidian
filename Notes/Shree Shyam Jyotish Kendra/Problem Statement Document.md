## 🧾 Modular CRM System Problem Statement (Expanded)

### 🧭 1. Context

The current operational workflow for our astrology business is fragmented, relying heavily on Excel sheets, WhatsApp messages, paper documentation, and unstructured links. There is no central hub for managing user data, appointments, tasks, content, marketing, inventory, or office operations.

This disorganization creates redundancy, delays, data loss, accountability gaps, and missed opportunities for customer retention or revenue optimization.

### 🚩 2. Goals

Build a **unified internal system** that:

- Consolidates fragmented workflows into **modular components**
    
- Enables **role-based access control** for team members
    
- Centralizes **user data**, **appointment flows**, **inventory**, **device**, and **campaign tracking**
    
- Simplifies **internal office management** and **staff coordination**
    
- Integrates with Telegram, Google Calendar, YouTube, Wati, Google Contacts, etc.
    
- Introduces automation, smart merging, and CRM intelligence
